<header>Weak Immunity With Sleep Deprivation</header>
<div id="container">
<h1>Insufficient sleep has been linked to a number of health problems. Here are some of them.</h1>
<p><b>Weight gain:</b> Not sleeping well for even one night can put your body in sleep debt. What's worse is that it may increase cravings and appetite. Sleep deprivation disturbs the balance of chemicals which signal the brain that you are full. As a result, you are likely to overeat even if you are full. This may lead to weight gain, obesity and other health risks linked to being overweight.</p>
<p><b>Diabetes risk:</b> Body's release of insulin can be affected by lack of sleep. Insulin is the hormone which is required to regulate blood sugar levels. People who don't sleep sufficiently are likely to have higher blood sugar levels and are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p><b>Weak immunity:</b> Sleeping too less can affect immune system's ability to fight virus that cause cold, flu and other infections. It makes you more susceptible to getting sick on being exposed to germs.</p>
<p><b>Mood swings:</b> Being sleep deprived for too long can make you short-tempered, moody and emotional. Being chronically sleep deprived can lead to anxiety and increase risk of depression.</p>
<p><b>Poor concentration and focus:</b> Your thinking, problem-solving skills, concentration and creativity can be negatively affected if you are sleep deprived and haven't rested well.</p>
<p><b>Poor balance:</b> Balance and coordination can be negatively affected if you have not been sleeping well off late. It increases your risk of falls and accidents.</p>
<p><b>High blood pressure:</b> Sleep deprivation needs to be taken seriously by hypertension patients. Sleeping for less than five hours at night increases your risk of getting high blood pressure.</p>
<p><b>Heart disease risk:</b> High blood pressure is one of the top causes of heart disease. Sleep deprivation can also increase inflammation in the body, which can also increase risk of heart disease.</p>
<p><b>Poor memory:</b> When you are asleep, the brain forms connections that can help you process and remember information. Not sleeping well can affect both short and long-term memory.</p>
